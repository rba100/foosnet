There are 18 C++ DLLs totalling 500mb that need to go in this project. 

They are not checked into source control because of their size.

They are the computer vision components of the OpenCV .NET port called EmguCV.

You need them to run the FoosNet.Vision components.

If you want them, either:
(1) Copy all the DLLs in \\jason64\Shared\FoosnetUnmanagedDLLs to this directory
(2) Download EmguCV from http://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/  
(3) Ask me (Jason Crease)
